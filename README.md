# developer-test
Small mobile app to test iOS knowledge

On startup the app should connect to this API: 

http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?query=ios 

which shows recently posted articles about iOS on Hacker News

If the app is used offline, it shows the items downloaded last time

The list view of recent posts is ordered by dates

And shows a web view with the linked article

Individual post could be deleted
